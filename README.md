tryC
====

Something similar to tryHaskell or tryruby for teaching the absolute basics of C to beginning programmers. The initial version does not claim to perfectly emulate all of the complexity involved in a real C compiler, but instead is intended for use as a teaching tool to help beginners learn the fundamental concepts involved in programming in C.
